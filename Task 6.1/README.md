Q: If the Sensor is surrounded by a noisy environment, what type of
filter could used and what is the recommended cutoff frequency
depending on the sensor datasheet?

###Answer:
> We can use a Low Pass Filter (LPF) to only allow low frequencies while blocking higher frequencies that may be caused by external noise
